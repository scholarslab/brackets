<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p></p>

<p>In this section you will be downloading a zip file containing two template documents. Our tutorial will guide you through understanding what these two documents are, the purposes the serve, and how they work in tandem to form the backbone of your personal portfolio site. Take a moment now to download the file <i>brackets.zip</i>. We suggest you save it in your home directory or your documents folder. This will be your starter kit and you will edit it through Visual Studio Code.</p>

<p>In the sections that follow, you will begin the process of building your own personal website. You will be using the documents from your starter kit to begin your journey of crafting your personal website. The operative word here is journey. Please work at your own pace and feel free to grow your website at whatever pace it takes for you to learn the technical skill we will teach you here. Most importantly, remember that this is also a space to have fun, to tinker, to learn through trial and error, and to embrace mistakes as a learning opportunity.</p>

<p>Websites are made of individual web pages and pages are stored in files, just like the files that live on your computer. The content of pages exist on your computer under the file extension, .html. A file extension is a standard way to indicate what kind of information a file contains so it can use the right software to read and write them. You are likely familiar with .doc or .pdf files. In these cases, your computer probably displays the information in Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat or Preview for Mac users, respectively. In the case of .html, these files will open on your default web browser. This is Google Chrome for us, but might also be Firefox, Safari, or Edge for you. <b>In the example you see below, the column on the left is called a code block. It is what the html template in your starter pack looks like and what your webpage looks like "under the hood". The column on the right is what that file looks like when opened on your default browser, a simple webpage.</b> Simply put, an .html file contains the basic text and structure of your website. The .html files are often named by standard conventions. The most common name used for the default or home page of a website is "index.html". This is one of the files included in your starter pack.</p>

<p>Websites are made of individual web pages and pages are stored in files, just like the files that live on your computer. The content of pages exist on your computer under the file extension, .html. A file extension is a standard way to indicate what kind of information a file contains so it can use the right software to read and write them. You are likely familiar with .doc or .pdf files. In these cases, your computer probably displays the information in Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat or Preview for Mac users, respectively. In the case of .html, these files will open on your default web browser. This is Google Chrome for us, but might also be Firefox, Safari, or Edge for you. Simply put, an .html file contains the basic text and structure of your website. The .html files are often named by standard conventions. The most common name used for the default or home page of a website is "index.html". This is one of the files included in your starter pack.</p>

<p>The second file included in your starter pack is a <i>style.css</i> file. CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheet" and this type of file is used to “style” the contents of an associated webpage. This .css file works in tandem with the <i>content</i> contained in an .html file to describe the <i>presentation</i> of that content. Think of your HTML document as laying out the text and structure of your page while CSS describes how that text is interpreted by the audience’s senses. Presentation encompasses how a page in a web browser or assistive technologies like screen readers should interpret the text. It is where you will define, among other things, the font and background color of your website, how the text is laid out, and how emphasis is emphasized. The standard naming convention for a Cascading Style Sheet is <i>style.css</i>.</p>

<h3>Part I: HTML</h3>
<p></p>

<h4>A Quick Primer</h4>
<p>Before we talk about specific HTML code, a quick primer on how to read HTML will be useful. HTML makes use of what are called <i>elements</i>, <i>tags</i>, and <i>attributes</i>.</p>

<p><ul type="disk">
<li><i>Elements</i> are the fundamental building blocks of an HTML page, and they are used to define the way in which particular content looks or functions. Elements are composed of tags, attributes, and content.</li>
<li><i>Tags</i> are used to indicate the way in which you want to structure particular content. A tag often appears in pairs with an opening and a closing tag, although this is not always the case (e.g., the image tag). If you want text to appear as a paragraph, for example, you would use the </li>
<li>Sometimes the opening tag (the first tag of the pair) might have a modifier to further explain the way in which you want the tag to function. This modifier is called an <i>attribute</i>. You will see attributes used in the case of link and image tags, for example. We speak at more length about these two tags below, but just to help you get a clearer sense of an attribute, here is the code to embed a link onto a web page: &lta href=“brackets.scholarslab.org”&gtYour Name Here&lt/a&gt The “href”, here–which is followed by the url–is the attribute. It modifies the anchor tag (&lta&gt&lt/a&gt) by specifying the exact url you want to link to.</li>  
<li>It is also important to note that when writing code, <i>case matters</i>, as does <i>spacing</i>. So, style.css, Style.css, Style.CSS, S tyle.css, S_tyle.css are all different. It is considered best practice to avoid spaces as much as possible.
</li>  
</ul></p>

<p>This <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">Mozilla developer webpage</a> is a great primer on HTML, if you would like to explore further.</p>

<p>It can often be fun, gratifying, and helpful to be able to see the code you write update your webpage in real time. You can keep a track of the changes to your webpage and see how your code functions by opening the index.html file in your web browser. In order to do this, either double-click on index.html in Finder/File Explorer or type the following command in the terminal: open[space]index.html</p>








<!--
<p><ul type="disk">
<li>If you visit any website and double-click/right-click on the page, a drop-down menu will appear.</li>
<li>Click on the Inspect option.</li> 
<li>A pop-up window will appear which will show you everything that is going on under the hood of that web-page; the coding that has gone into making the site what it is.</li> 
<li>Don’t be overwhelmed by all the code that you see and if you don’t know how to parse it! Some websites will make use of more complicated code than others, and it’ll take some time to become comfortable with the particular language and visuals. In the meantime, feel free to “inspect” this particular web-page that you’re on. Our code is likely to be simpler than that of a lot of other websites, and you could even change bits of it to see how that changes the page. Don’t worry none of it will be permanent! And our personal, easy favorite is playing around with the colors on the webpage.</li>
</ul></p>

<li><p>Moving on to HTML now! First, create a folder for your project somewhere on your computer. The location doesn't matter, it just needs to be somewhere accessible to you. This one folder will be a container to hold all the documents, files, and images which will go into the making of your website.</p></li>

<li><p>Within that folder, you are going to create an html and a css file. Websites are composed of pages; pages are just files that live somewhere. Imagine the navigation bar of your personal webpage. In addition to your homepage, you might also have a separate page for “Resources” and another for “Teaching”. Each of these pages exist as separate HTML files. Make a folder on your computer that holds your pages. If you want to add images to your website, it is helpful to make a sub-folder for your images as well. How you name these image files is not important.</p> 
<p><ul type="disk">
<li>Name the first file, which will be your homepage, index.html</li>
<li>Any subsequent files will correspond to other pages of your website. For example: resources.html or teaching.html</li>
<li>The next file you create will be a "Cascading Style Sheet" or CSS file. Name this file style.css</li>
<li>When it comes to creating files, you can do this in two ways: 
    <ul type="circle">
    <li>You can create the file on the terminal by entering the following command: touch[space][name of file]</li>
    <li>You can create the file as you “normally” would on Finder or File Explorer as well; just make sure to navigate to the main folder you’re working within.</li></ul>  </li>
</ul></p></li>

<li><p>Open the HTML file in your internet browser–our default is Google Chrome, and we will be proceeding with the assumption that all of us are working on Chrome. However, feel free to use the internet browser you prefer. You can open the HTML file in your browser in any of the following two ways:</p>

<p><ul type="disk">
<li>You can double-click on your index.html file by going to the file in Finder or File Explorer (basically, how you would “normally” open a file). This will automatically open your file in the internet browser.</li>
<li>You can also open the HTML file via the terminal. In order to do this, enter the following command: open[space]index.html</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Here, the file is in “read” view. This means that you can see your webpage as it stands at any moment, so keep saving your file and refreshing the browser every time you make a change in order to check your work. When you work on the file in VS Code, it is in “edit” view. This means that you can change, modify, work on your document in this space. Again, remember to save in VS Code after you make any changes. Then, refresh your Chrome browser to see those changes appear in the "read" view.</p></li> 

<li><p>At the top of your HTML file, you will need to add a header with particular code. You can access templates for this boiler-plate code on <a href="https://www.toptal.com/developers/htmlshell">toptal.com</a></p>
<ul type="disk"><p>This is what this boiler-plate code generally looks like:</p> 
<img src="HTML Boilerplate Header code.png" width="450" height="320" alt="HTML Boiler-plate Header Code" Align="center"/></ul>
<p><ul type="disk">Everything bracketed in the head tag happens behind the scenes, while everything bracketed in the body tag will show up on your website. A more detailed explanation of the boiler-plate code contained within the head tags can be found here.</ul></p> 
</li>

<li><p>Markup written content and paste it into VS Code. We will first talk about what it means to “markup” content. Let’s assume, for example, that you are designing the homepage for your website. Do the following:</p>

<p><ul type="disk"><li>Gather the written material that will go on this homepage.</li>
    <li>Divide this material into headers, paragraphs, lists using tags.</li> 
    <li>Add links that you might want on the page, for ex. to other websites you want to point visitors to.</li>
    <li>Add images as well as “alt text.”</li></ul></p>
    
    </li>
</ol>
