<p>So you've decided to create a personal website. Outlined below you will find steps that will help you begin building your website. Before getting started with this tutorial it will be help to start drafting some of the content for your personal website </p>

<h2>Developer Tools</h2>
<p>Before we begin taking you through HTML and CSS specifically, here’s a tool that will come in handy: Web Developer Tools, and specifically the “Inspect Element.” too. If you visit any website and double-click/right-click on the page, a drop-down menu will appear.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click on the Inspect option.</li>
    <li>A pop-window will appear which will show you everything that is going on under the hood of that web-page; the coding that has gone into making the site what it is.</li>
    <li>Don’t be overwhelmed by all the code that you see and if you don’t know how to parse it! Some websites will make use of more complicated code than others, and it’ll take some time to become comfortable with the particular language and visuals. In the meantime, feel free to “inspect” this particular web-page that you’re on. Our code is likely to be simpler than that of a lot of other websites, and you could even change bits of it to see how that changes the page. Don’t worry none of it will be permanent! And our personal, easy favorite is playing around with the colors on the webpage.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Set Up</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Create a folder for your project somewhere on your computer. The location doesn't matter, it just needs to be somewhere accessible to you. This one folder will be a container to hold all your material - for example… </li>
    <li>Within that folder, you are going to create an html and a css file. Websites are all pages; pages are just files that live somewhere. Imagine the navigation bar of your personal webpage. In addition to your homepage, you might also have a separate page for “Resources” and another for “Teaching”. Each of these pages exist as separate HTML files. Make a folder on your computer that holds your pages. If you want to add images to your website, it is helpful to make a sub-folder for your images as well. How you name these image files is not important.</li>

<h1>Your Guide to CSS</h1>

<p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheet". Coding with CSS will help style the content in your HTML document.. CSS describes how the elements in your HTML document should be displayed and helps format the layout. Using this style language you will select or reference certain things, or elements, on a webpage in order to change and define properties such as typography, color, and sizing. Think of your HTML document as laying out the bones and body of your webpage while CSS gives it its distinct appearance and look. Consider these two memes, we think they help capture how CSS works with HTML to give your webpage its look and appearance.
