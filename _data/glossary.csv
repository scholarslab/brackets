term,definition
Git (Joseph),"Git is software that allows us to work on our own projects (like this website), or collaborate as a group. Like Homebrew, Git is a free and open source project. One of the best things about Git is how it tracks every single change that we will make, which is obviously ideal for group projects as well. Git will manage our source code and store it directly on our computer’s."
GitHub ,GitHub is a website that provides web hosting and allows developers to collaborate and practice version control using Git. 
VS Code (Joseph),"Unless you have another preference, VSCode is an incredibly user friendly code editor. As newcomers, we found the debugging support to be helpful in writing, testing and even learning what code is. VSCode can read a wide range of coding languages including HTML, CSS and Python. The editor highlights any errors within your code and even suggests ways to fix them."
Terminal (Tarushi),"You know the little icons and drop down menus on your computer screen? And how you use your mouse/trackpad to accomplish different tasks on the computer by clicking, double-clicking, right-clicking, left-clicking, etc.? The terminal allows you to do all of these things, except through written commands. The terminal is also called the command line, and on a Mac, it comes pre-installed. Some common commands people use include: ""touch[space][file name]"" to create files' ""mkdir[space][folder name]"" to create folders; and ""ls"" to list all the files and directories which exist in the location you're currently situated in."

Stack Overflow (jacquii) ,"[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a question-and-answer website for developers, where coders help solve each other's problems. It is a great place to check if you get stuck, but isn't [without downsides](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2021.1962943)."
Clone (jacqui) ,"In Git, to clone a repository means to make a copy of it that lives on your computer, which you can then make changes to and later ""push"" back onto the site. "

Pixel (px) (Cherrie),a basic unit of measurement for the screen

"Code (Jennifer) - This could be a way to give explicit definitions of our idea of ""coding""",
Margin (Jennifer),

Value (Jennifer),
Selector (Jennifer),
Delclaration Block (Jennifer),
Environment Set-Up (Joseph),An Environment Setup: gathering and downloading all of the things that we will need to code and design a website. This is a vital initial step that can take those less comfortable with technology longer than expected (which is completewly fine!). 
Boilerplate templates (Joseph),"Gives us newcomers a great starting point. Provides a bit of code that we can work off of: a foundation to build from. Much like starting with a microsoft word template, but in code form. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz8ml5bOid0) is a good YouTube tutorial. "
WSL (Joseph),"Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets you run a Linux environment, which includes command-line tools and apps (in Windows) "

Git Bash will serve as a command-line shell, which will enable you to use git with the command line in the system. A shell is an application used to communicate with an operating system through your written commands. The Git Bash package includes several components: Bash (Bourne Again Shell), a few basic bash utilities, and Git. Git Bash will enable you to work with the repository and git elements through the commands. If this description sounded like mind-numbing jargon — you are not alone. With that being said, these applications and systems will begin to make a lot more sense as we start to use them to build your site (trust me!)."
Version control (Jacqui) ,"Version control is the practice of tracking changes to software code, so that previous versions can be accessed later. "
Commit (Jacqui) ,"In GitHub, a commit is a revision or change to a repository. When you make a commit, you must leave a ""commit message"" for yourself or others on your team about the changes that were made, which helps keep track of the project's revision history. "
