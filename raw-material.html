<h1>Brainstorming(Visualizing) Your Website</h1>
<p>On this page, we offer an exciting set of suggestions, framing questions, and prompts for you to brainstorm different sections of your website, and reflect on how you want to present yourself and share your work at large.</p>
<p>The pressures of the ivory tower can sometimes scare us into thinking that we must present ourselves solely through our institutional affiliations or through a long list of our accomplishments and publications, lest anyone should think that we are not a "rigorous" scholar." These concerns are especially urgent for those whom the academy has typically marked as suspicious, inadequate, or illegible, such as graduate students and faculty of color, first-generation students, non-traditional students, independent scholars, openly queer academics, and non-tenure track faculty. So often, those who belong to these groups are pressured into presenting themselves in a certain way because they face loud claims that their work is not "really" valuable, or that they were selected or hired not because of their intellectual acumen, life experience, work ethic, or pedagogical efficacy, but to tick a diversity box.</p>
<p>Yet we know that these loud claims are myths that those who see themselves as gatekeepers of the ivory tower have fabricated. They have done so because they, too, live in fear. They are watching another generation of scholars emerge: a generation that is not only far more radical in its intellectual, social, and political sensibilities, but a generation who—having witnessed countless institutional betrayals, deeply exploitative working conditions, and unacceptable abuses of power by tenured professors—are now developing new perspectives about what the academy is, what it can become, how we should treat one another, and how we should do the work we do.</p>
<p>In line with our charter's commitment to "decenter[ing] performance and rigor in favor of generosity, joy, and experimentation," we have constructed these resources to help you write about yourself and share your work along the intertwined principles of individuality and solidarity that we outlined in our teaching philosophy. Beating at the heart of our pedagogical emphasis on "molding of the free personality" is our hope that you will feel more empowered to be true to yourself, and to share that self with the world online.</p>
<p>We suggest that this brainstorming process take place prior to website creation and coding. The materials created here will be used when you start building your site. That being said, please break the rules. You can move through these steps and this site in any order. If you prefer, you can start on your site using <a href="https://loremipsum.io/">lorem ipsum</a> as placeholder text. </p> 
<h2>Individuality</h2>
<h3>About Page</h3>
<p>When describing ourselves, we often fall back on rote, flat-affect templates where we list our institutional affiliations or awards. Yet these titles are not the only dimensions that comprise who we are, or they do little by way of showing why we have chosen to focus on the particular kinds of research, teaching, and service that we produce. </p>
<p>Why do you do the work you do? What drew you to higher education? How have you changed since then—and what keeps you going? What is most important to you? What is least important to you? What are your hopes for the future? Writing an About page focused on questions like these might help us all understand each other and our work with more depth, sincerity, and generosity, and we have provided some prompts and exercises below for you to get started.</p>
<h4>Free Writing</h4><i>(courtesy Brandon Walsh)</i>
<ol>
    <li>Don't judge what you write</li>
    <li>Feel free to use the first person</li>
    <li>Keep your fingers typing, your pen moving, etc.</li>
    <li>Be honest. Don't write what you think someone else wants to hear.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Prompts:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Start with a two-sentence description of what you studied in school. Then, begin writing for 6 minutes using this prompt: "I went to school so that...in order to...because..." If you get stuck, return to the prompt and start a new sentence, "I went to school because..."</li>
    <li>Find a childhood photograph of yourself that speaks to you in some way. If you do not have access to a photograph, you can use a childhood memory. You will know you have the right photo or memory by how it makes you feel, you will be compelled by it in some way. Write about it for 6 minutes. Let you feelings about it reveal themselves to you through free-write.</li>
    <li>Write about your first day of school in higher education. Be descriptive. What sounds, smells, sights greeted you on the first day? What did the campus look like? What was the feeling in the air? Who did you meet? What was the weather like? What time of year was it? What one or two things really stand out in your memory? Describe everything you are able.</li>
</ol>
<p>Come back to your free-writes after a break and take a moment to reflect. What are some of the questions that surfaced as you were writing? Where did you linger? Where did you stop? Why did you stop? If you had a hard time writing, why is that so?</p>
<p>Using your insights from your own writing plus your inspiration examples, create a few different drafts of your own biography. Consider how your personal experiences, hobbies, and identity contribute to the work you do. Try writing one a paragraph long, one a page long, and one a sentence long.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Below, we provide some autobiographical blurbs that we thought were especially inspirational.</p>
<ul>
    <li> <a href="https://laurencgarcia.com/">Lauren Garcia</a></li>
    <li> <a href="http://zairelove.com/about/">Zaire Love</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Alternatives to Free Writing</h4>
<p>If you don't feel comfortable expressing your story through a written narrative, there are other ways to express your individuality in your website's biography. Some examples that we saw in our research included creating a map of the different locations one has worked, studied, and lived, and making a photo slideshow of one's desk or office.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<ul>
    <li> <a href=https://rosalieb.github.io/rosaliebruelweb/my_map.html>Rosalie Bruel's map</a></li>
    <li>See <a href=https://www.jorgelucero.com/new-page-2>the virtual tour of Jorge Lucero's STUDYCOLLECTION</a>, inspiration for the idea to create a photo tour of a desk, office, or other personal space.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Headshots</h3>
<p>Headshots are obviously not mandatory but if you do decide to provide one, we invite you to reflect on what you want that image to convey. As students who live and study at the University of Virginia, we are aware that our campus was not only built by enslaved laborers but also <a href=https://eidolon.pub/classical-slavery-and-jeffersonian-racism-28cbcdf53364>architecturally designed in ways that sought to separate white students and faculty from Black communities and reinforce white supremacy.</a> That is why—for our team at least—we have resisted taking headshots that center locations like the Rotunda, the Grecian columns, or the serpentine walls.</p>
<p>Instead, we have sought to consider how our headshots can reflect who we are, as a scholar and as a person, and we offer these questions to you as well. Is there an outfit, a hairstyle, a color, a space that makes you feel most like yourself? Can you list some adjectives you want the headshot to convey? Are there any objects or particular settings that would help express your identity?</p>
<p>Perhaps you already have a favorite photograph of yourself that expresses your free personality. What is your favorite photo of yourself? Why do you like it? Could you use this photo for your headshot? If not, consider how you could incorporate characteristics of this image into your new headshot.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Below we offer some examples of headshots that we felt captured the individuals' personalities particularly well.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://laurencgarcia.com/">Lauren Garcia</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://zairelove.com/about">Zaire Love</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Solidarity</h2>
<h3>Land Acknowledgement</h3>
<p>We encourage you to consider including a land acknowledgement on your site if you are living, working, and producing research on the homelands of native peoples. This process involves doing research about what a land acknowledgement is, as well as the indigenous history of the locations that you need to acknowledge. It is important to know the indigenous people who stewarded the land in the past and who live there presently, as well as the history of any treaties that apply to that land.</p>
<p>This process is meant to be contemplative, not rushed. As land acknowledgements have become more widely adopted, their popularity and repetition has spurred a conversation about whether they truly disrupt colonial dynamics, or if they are becoming empty gestures. Metis writer ​​âpihtawikosisân, for example, <a href="https://apihtawikosisan.com/2016/09/beyond-territorial-acknowledgments/">has encouraged us to move beyond the rote copy-and-paste acknowledgement, and toward having direct conversations with indigenous communities and highlighting their expectations and needs.</a> If being in conversation with indigenous communities is not an available option for you, another starting point might be to highlight local native activism in your area, or express solidarity with the broader <a href="https://landback.org/">landback movement.</a></p>
<p>Below are some additional resources to assist you in researching and writing a land acknowledgement: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li><p> <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Native Land Digital</a>:</p>
    <p>This is an interactive map that allows users to identify the native peoples, languages, and treaties specific to particular locations.  They also have a <a href="https://native-land.ca/resources/territory-acknowledgement/">guide and collection of resources</a> for writing a land acknowledgment.</p></li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.csusm.edu/cicsc/land.pdf">Land Acknowledgement Toolkit</a> by California Indian Culture and Sovereignty Center and California State University San Marcos American Indian Studies</li>
    <li> <a href="https://nativegov.org/news/a-guide-to-indigenous-land-acknowledgment/">A Guide to Indigenous Land Acknowledgement</a> by the Native Governance Center</li>
    <p>These are two step-by-step guides to writing land acknowledgements that we found helpful. The CICSC toolkit is specific to California, but any location can be substituted.</p>
