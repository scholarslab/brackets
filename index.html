<p>Our open educational resource, <em>Insert Name Here</em>, aims to empower others with the coding skills and the confidence to create a personal website that reflects who they are and what they value to the public. Inspired by critical pedagogy, anarchist education, and our own experiences in graduate school, our pedagogical method centers individuality and solidarity.</p>
