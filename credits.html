<h2>Gratitude</h2>
<p>We would like to say a heartfelt thank-you to the following individuals and institutions for guidance and support on this journey. Broadly speaking, the Scholars' Lab staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and supported â€” even when we were not sure that we belonged. They freely passed along their knowledge, embraced our growing pains and constantly reminded us how much they appreciated our efforts.</p>

<p>Thank you to Ronda for helping us talk about our feelings and much needed guidance on project management.</p>
<h3>Shane Lin</h3>
<p>Thank you to Shane for making sure everyone was always heavily caffeinated, taking our photos, teaching us to code, and contributing the "publish" page to our site.</p>
<h3> <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/">The Scholars' Lab</a></h3>
<p>Thank you to the Scholars' Lab for carving out a radically kind space in academia where we can envision and practice a different vision of what our work can look like.</p>
<h3><a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">The Praxis Program</a></h3>
<p>The Praxis Program is a one-year fellowship in which six graduate students from different disciplines spend the fall semester learning digital humanities theory and methods, and the spring semester collaborating to create their own DH project. We are grateful we had the opportunity to participate in this unique program.</p>
