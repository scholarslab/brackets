<h2> Design Ethos </h2>

<h4>
By “Design Ethos” we mean design ethics, the guiding principles of design, and what questions to consider when designing. </h4>

<p>
Why is design important? 
	
Design has many forms. It is a nebulous, moving target. What makes design “good” or “bad” for us, may not be what makes it “good” or “bad” for you. Instead, we want to articulate why it's important to be intentional about design, and offer what that intentionality could look like in the practice of designing your personal website. We believe that as designers, we have an ethical responsibility to “do no harm” or as Nidhip Mehta asks can we “use design as a vehicle to aid and assist humanity, decrease oppression, and promote good will?” We hope to use design in a way that is responsible and ethical, addresses accessibility and inclusion, and represents our individual aesthetics, and personalities, ie. is also filled with delight and fun! 
	
With this in mind, we’ve selected a few key ideas to our design ethos in creating this page and our personal sites. These concepts have impacted our framing of the project and we hope they help you to communicate your own design ethos.

<h4> On “Professionalism” </h4>

<p> As graduate students, we are often told that it is our responsibility to convey a certain type of “professionalism” which usually means to simplify our individual personalities and our work to comply with the unattainable, “Ivory Tower'' standard . To strip away our whole selves into just our successful academic selves, or in essence, to turn ourselves into markable capital. As stated in The Undercommons, </p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.minorcompositions.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/undercommons-web.pdf">
	Maroon communities of composition teachers, mentorless graduate students, adjunct Marxist historians, out or queer management professors, state college ethnic studies departments, closed-down flm programs, visaexpired Yemeni student newspaper editors, historically black college sociologists, and feminist engineers. And what will the university say of them? It will say they are unprofessional. This is not an arbitrary charge. It is the charge against the more than professional. How do those who exceed the profession, who exceed and by exceeding escape, how do those maroons problematize themselves, problematize the university, force the university to consider them a problem, a danger? The undercommons is not, in short, the kind of fanciful communities of whimsy invoked by Bill Readings at the end of his book. The undercommons, its maroons, are always at war, always in hiding.

<p>Your Name Here questions the desire to remain, what the institution deems, “professional.” Through design, we can let more aspects of our personalities and whole selves shine, while still forefronting our contributions to the field. We believe you can use design and a personal website to subvert the Ivory Tower’s push to turn us all into capital. 

When writing this page and working on Your Name Here, we were inspired by and used ideas from several authors, articles, and books including: {list of sources} </p>

<h4> Audience </h4>

<p> When searching for “design audience,” Google yields plenty of advice for successfully designing a site for a “target audience.” Prompting questions like “What drives your audience? What are their beliefs and values? Who are they? What products do they use?” Even some sites go so far as to give your target audience  “real identity” by cutting out a picture of someone in a magazine and placing their image near your workspace. Manifestation, witchcraft, or just creepy? 

While these can be useful questions to help think about potential visitors to your site, and who you may want to design it for, we want to emphasize that there is no one, single, perfect, or ideal audience member. We think that designing for a single, ideal audience member can lead to many potential pitfalls, including issues with accessibility and inclusion, putting aside your personal preferences in favor of something that someone else may hypothetically like better, and projecting your personal beliefs onto that “ideal standard.” Instead, we offer other questions and suggestions for thinking about the audience in a way that opens up the potential of your site. As Jutta Treviranus, Director of the Inclusive Design Research Centre at Ontario College of Art & Design University, writes, “design with human uniqueness and variability.” 
	
Accessibility and inclusion is also an important consideration for your design audience. Having access to information and being able to understand online information is a basic, human right. Treviranus writes, “Including difference is how we evolve as a human society. Inclusive design is about far more than addressing disability. But disability has been called our last frontier. It is the human difference that our social structures have not yet integrated. This is paradoxical because disability is a potential state we can all find ourselves in. If we reject and exclude individuals who experience disabilities, we reject and exclude our future selves and our loved ones.”
	
We have taken the framework laid out by Treviranus to help guide our design practice and we hope can help guide yours. </p>
	
<ol>
	<li>Recognize, respect, and design with human uniqueness and variability.</li>
	<li>Use inclusive, open & transparent processes, and co-design with people who have a diversity of perspectives, including people that can’t use or have difficulty using the current designs.</li>
	<li>Realize that you are designing in a complex adaptive system.</li>
